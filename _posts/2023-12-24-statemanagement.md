# Demystifying State Management in React

State management is a crucial aspect of building robust and interactive React applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with React, understanding how to manage state effectively is essential for creating seamless user experiences.

## What is State?

In React, state is a JavaScript object that represents the parts of your application that can change over time. It holds the dynamic data of your components, allowing them to update and re-render based on user interactions or other events.

## Local Component State

React components can have local state managed within the component itself. This is achieved using the `useState` hook, a powerful addition in React functional components.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
